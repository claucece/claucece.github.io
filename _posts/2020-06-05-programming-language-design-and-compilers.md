title:  "Programming language design and compilers: where to start?"
---

Over the past months, I have gotten more and more interested on how programming
languages are designed, why such decisions are made, and the compiler role into
this. I think that I started getting interested because of a current research
around Golang's compiler, and I got amazed by the amount of beauty that
designing a language can create.

Lurking into Golang's archive [1], I stumbled upon two very interesting papers
that influenced their design. Those papers are "Hints on Programming Language
Design" [2] by C. A. R. Hoare and "Everything You've Wanted to Know about
Programming Languages but Have Been Afraid to Ask" [3] by C. A. R. Hoare.
