# Post-quantum Cryptography and running experiments with it at Cloudflare

*Because quantum cats have 7 lives*

Today, I'm speaking at Cloudflare CFTV ([Cloudflare TV](https://cloudflare.tv/event/5G46CmInDoEyAFmk9Ewi3O)),
with my colleague Armando Faz Hernández. This is very exciting as the talks
given there are always of an extremely good quality. This is happening as
part of my ongoing work with Cloudflare where I have been part of many
amazing projects since I started some months ago (see this [tweet](https://twitter.com/claucece/status/1336432849365446658))
for an idea). The talk will be around the state of post-quantum cryptography
and will be in Spanish (which is something you don't see around at cryptography
talks). But, most excitingly, we will be talking about an ongoing experiment we
are running at Cloudflare: Post-quantum KEMs in TLS 1.3.

So, what is the PQ KEM TLS experiment? Basically, it is an experiment that will
run on Cloudflare to gather measurements on using PQ KEMs as part of a TLS 1.3
connection. A KEM, in this case, is a Key Encapsulation Mechanism used to
achieve server and/or client authentication without the usage of digital
signatures. This is due to the fact that signatures in a post-quantum setting
have larger sizes than the alternative KEMs. Part of the experiment is also
making as few changes as possible to the TLS 1.3 handshake. As we are unable to
make changes to Certificate Authorities at the moment, we will be using
[Delegated Credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-subcerts-03)
as an alternative. KEM TLS achieves, therefore, a TLS handshake that provides
full post-quantum security. We will be presenting this work at Real World Crypto
2021.

On the talk, we will give an overview of the experiment and we will also discuss
what post-quantum cryptography is and came to be.

I'll leave some additional resources:
