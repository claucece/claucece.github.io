*Running post-quantum experiments*

Fundamentally, the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS), which secures most
of the Internet connections, has mainly been a key exchange authenticated by
digital signatures<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup>. Even though it has undergone major changes since 1994, when
SSL 1.0 was introduced by Netscape, it’s main mechanism has remained the same.
The key exchange that is used was first based on RSA and later on (elliptic
curve) Diffie-Hellman. The signatures used for authentication have almost always
been RSA-based, though in recent years other kinds of signatures have been
adopted, mainly ECDSA and Ed25519. This recent change to elliptic curve
cryptography at both at a key exchange and signature level has resulted in
considerable speed and bandwidth benefits in comparison to classic
Diffie-Hellman and RSA.

TLS is the main protocol that protects the connections we use everyday. It is
everywhere: it is used when we buy products online, when we register for a
newsletter or when we access any kind of website. But, with the imminent
threat of [the arrival of quantum computers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/)
(a threat that seems to be getting closer and closer), we need to reconsider
again the future of TLS. [A wide-scale post-quantum experiment](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/)
was carried out by Cloudflare and Google: two post-quantum key exchanges were
integrated into Cloudflare's TLS stack and deployed at their edge servers and in
Chrome Canary clients. The goal of that experiment was to evaluate the
performance and feasibility of deployment of two post-quantum key exchanges in
TLS.

Similar experiments have been proposed for introducing post-quantum algorithms
into the TLS handshake itself. But, they all seem infeasible to be introduced at
authentication by signature and key exchange levels as, unfortunately,
post-quantum cryptographic primitives are bigger, or slower (or both) than
their predecessors. The proposed algorithms under consideration in
the [NIST post-quantum standardization process](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions)
use larger mathematical objects than what is used for elliptic curves,
traditional Diffie-Hellman or RSA. As a result, the size of public keys,
signatures and key exchange material is much bigger than those from elliptic
curves, Diffie-Hellman or RSA.

How can we solve this problem? How can we use post-quantum algorithms as part
of the TLS handshake without making the material too big to be transmitted? In
this blogpost, we will introduce a new mechanism for making this happen, explain
how it can be integrated into the TLS 1.3 handshake and talk about
implementation details. The key observation in this mechanism is that, while
post-quantum algorithms have bigger communication size than their predecessors,
post-quantum key exchanges have somewhat smaller sizes than post-quantum
signatures, so we can try to replace key exchanges with signatures in some
places to save space. We will only focus on the TLS 1.3 handshake as it is the
TLS version that should be currently used.

## The past experiments: making the traditional TLS 1.3 handshake post-quantum

[TLS 1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446) was introduced in August 2018
with many security and performance improvements (notably, having only one
round-trip to complete the handshake). But TLS 1.3 is designed for a world with
classical computers, and some of its functionalities will be broken by quantum
computers when they arrive.

The primary goals of TLS 1.3 are to provide authentication (the server side of
the channel is always authenticated, the client side is optionally
authenticated), confidentiality and integrity by using a handshake protocol and
a record protocol. The handshake protocol, the one of interest for us today,
establishes the cryptographic parameters for securing and authenticating a
connection. It can be thought of as of having three main phases, as defined in
[RFC8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446):

* The **Parameter Negotiation** phase (referred to as ‘Server Parameters’ in
  RFC8446), which establishes some handshake parameters (whether the client is
  authenticated, application-layer protocol support, etc).

* The **Key Exchange** phase, which establishes shared keying material and
  selects the cryptographic parameters to be used. Everything after this phase
  will be encrypted.

* The **Authentication** phase, which authenticates the server (and, optionally,
  the client) and provides key confirmation and handshake integrity.

<br>
The main idea of past experiments that introduced post-quantum algorithms into
the handshake of TLS 1.3 was to use them in place of classical algorithms by
advertising them as part of the [supported groups](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.7)
(an extension used by the client to indicate which named groups -Elliptic Curve
Groups, Finite Field Groups- it supports for key exchange)
and [key share](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.8) (an extension
which contains the endpoint’s cryptographic parameters) extensions, and, therefore,
establishing with them the negotiated connection parameters. Key encapsulation
mechanisms (KEMs) are an abstraction of the basic key exchange primitive and
were used to generate the shared secrets. In the case of using a [pre-shared key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.11),
its symmetric algorithms can be easily replaced by post-quantum KEMs, as well;
and, in the case of password-authenticated TLS, there has been some
[proposed ideas](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1192.pdf) on how to use
post-quantum algorithms with them.

<br>

<br>

Most of the above ideas only provide what is often defined as ‘transitional
security’, as its main focus is providing quantum-resistant confidentiality,
but do not take into account quantum-resistant authentication. The idea of
using post-quantum signatures for TLS authentication is possible, but the sizes
of post-quantum signatures are larger than traditional ones. Furthermore, it is
worth noting that using [post-quantum signatures is much heavier than using
post-quantum KEMs](https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2019/the-2nd-round-of-the-nist-pqc-standardization-proc).

We can estimate the impact of such a replacement on network traffic by simply
looking at the sum of the cryptographic objects that are transmitted during the
handshake. In a typical TLS 1.3 handshake using elliptic curve X25519 and
RSA-2048, such a handshake would transmit 1376 bytes corresponding to: the
public keys for key exchange, the certificate, the signature of the handshake,
and the certificate chain. If we were to replace X25519 by the post-quantum
KEM [Kyber512](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) and RSA by the post-quantum
signature [Dilithium II](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/), two of the more
efficient proposals, the size of the transmitted data would increase to 10036
bytes. This increase is mostly due to the size of the post-quantum signature
algorithm.

The question then is: how can we achieve full post-quantum security and create a
handshake that is efficient to be used?

# A more efficient proposal: KEMTLS

There is a long history of other mechanisms, besides signatures, being used for
authentication. Modern protocols, such as the Signal protocol, the Noise
framework or WireGuard, rely on key exchange mechanisms for authentication, which
are somewhat unsuitable for the TLS 1.3 case as they expect the long-term key
material to be known in advance by the interested parties.

The [OPTLS proposal](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/978.pdf) by Krawczyk and Wee
gives authentication for the TLS handshake without signatures by using a
non-interactive key exchange (NIKE). However, the only somewhat efficient
construction for a post-quantum NIKE is CSIDH, the security of which is the
subject of ongoing debate. But, we can build on this idea by using KEMs for
authentication. KEMTLS, the current proposed experiment, replaces the handshake
signature by a post-quantum KEM key exchange. It was designed and introduced
by Peter Schwabe, Douglas Stebila and Thom Wiggers in the
publication [‘Post-Quantum TLS Without Handshake Signatures’](https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/kemtls/kemtls.pdf).

KEMTLS, therefore, gives the same goals as TLS 1.3 (authentication,
confidentiality and integrity) in the face of quantum computers for both clients
and servers. One small difference compared to TLS 1.3 is that KEMTLS only allows
to send application data since the second client-to-server TLS message flow
(TLS 1.3 allows the server to send encrypted and authentication application data
in its first response message).

Intuitively, the handshake signature in TLS 1.3 proves possession of the private
key corresponding to the public key certified in the TLS 1.3 server certificate.
For these signature schemes, this is the straightforward way to prove
possession; but it’s also possible to make such proof through key exchanges. By
carefully considering the key derivation sequence, only the server holding the
private key that corresponds to the certified public key can decrypt any
messages sent by the client to the server. Therefore, implicit authentication
is fulfilled. It is worth noting that KEMTLS still relies on signatures by
certificate authorities to authenticate the long-term KEM keys.

As said, KEMTLS’ application data transmitted during the handshake is implicitly,
rather than explicitly authenticated (as in TLS 1.3), and has slightly weaker
downgrade resilience and forward secrecy; but full downgrade resilience and
forward secrecy is achieved once the KEMTLS handshake completes.

<br>

By replacing the handshake signature by a KEM key exchange, we reduce the size
of the data transmitted in the example handshake using Kyber512 and Dilithium II
to 8344 bytes, a significant reduction. Even for algorithms, such the
NTRU-assumption based KEM NTRU and signature algorithm Falcon, that have a
less-pronounced size gap, we still reduce bytes. KEM operations are typically
computationally much lighter than signing operations as well, which makes the
reduction even more significant.

KEMTLS was presented at ACM CCS 2020. You can read more about its details in
the [paper](https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/kemtls/kemtls.pdf). It was
initially implemented in the [RustTLS library](https://github.com/thomwiggers/kemtls-experiment) by
Thom Wiggers using optimized C/assembly implementations of the post-quantum
algorithms provided by the [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) and
[Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) projects.

## Cloudflare and KEMTLS: the implementation

As part of our effort to show that TLS can be completely post-quantum safe, we
implemented the full KEMTLS handshake over the Golang’s TLS 1.3 suite. The
implementation was done in several steps:

* We first needed to clone our own version of Golang, so we could add different
  post-quantum algorithms to it. You can find our own version [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/).
  This code gets constantly updated with every release of Golang, following [these steps](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/wiki/Starting-out).
* We needed to implement post-quantum algorithms in Golang, which we did on our
  own cryptographic library [CIRCL](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/tree/master/kem).
* As we cannot force Certificate Authorities to use certificates with long-term
  post-quantum KEM keys, we decided to use [Delegated Credentials](https://blog.cloudflare.com/keyless-delegation/).
  A delegated credential is a short-lasting key that the certificate’s owner has
  delegated for use in TLS 1.3. Therefore, they can be used for having
  post-quantum KEM keys. See its implementation in our Golang code [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/tree/cf-delegated-credentials).
* We implemented mutual auth (client and server authentication) KEMTLS by using
  Delegated Credentials for the authentication process. See its implementation
  in our Golang code [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/tree/cf-pq-kemtls).
  You can also check this [test](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/blob/cf-pq-kemtls/src/crypto/tls/delegated_credentials_test.go#L774)
  for an overview of how it works.

<br>
Implementing KEMTLS was a straightforward process, although it did require
changes to the way Golang handles a TLS 1.3 handshake and how the key schedule
works.

A “regular” TLS 1.3 handshake in Golang (from the server perspective) looks like
this:

<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/golang_tls.png" alt="Implemented Golang TLS 1.3 Handshake" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left:auto; height:600px;" />

We had to interrupt at the point that the server sends the Certificate
(`sendServerCertificate()`) in order to send the KEMTLS specific messages. In
the same way, we had to add the appropriate KEM TLS messages to the client’s
handshake. And, as we did not want to change so much the way Golang handles
TLS 1.3, we only added one new constant to the configuration that can be used
by a server in order to ask for the Client’s Certificate (the constant
is `serverConfig.ClientAuth = RequestClientKEMCert`).

The implementation is easy to work with: if a delegated credential or a
certificate has a public key of a supported post-quantum KEM algorithms, the
handshake will proceed with KEMTLS. If the server requests for a Client KEMTLS
Certificate, the handshake will invoke client KEMTLS authentication.

## Running the Experiment

So, what is next? What is next is to take the code we have produce and run it
in the actual Cloudflare infrastructure to measure how efficient it works.
