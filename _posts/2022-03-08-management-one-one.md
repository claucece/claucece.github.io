*Why I love good 1:1s*

These days, I've been reflecting. Reflecting on the status of the world, research
and many other things. On the work side, I've been reflecting on how to
properly run teams and how to make people be heard. I'm no expert on this and,
while I do have some management and leadership experience, I have lots of things
to learn. I have managed/lead 3 teams now of various sizes. My first experience
with managing a team was a disaster: I failed in every way. But I've learned better.
Here, I'll like to share things that I've learned, books and advise that
have helped me, and how to add diversity and inclusion into managing. What
I will mostly like to focus on this blog post are 1:1s and why they are a
central core to any team dynamic. I'll be talking of my experience over the
years as a member of the software community.

## 1:1s

<br>

We all know that 1:1s are, we have all have had them. But sometimes we don't know
what a *good* 1:1 is. For me, 1:1s are an opportunity to learn what are
the success, challenges and needs of a person. It is not an status update or
reporting. It is the most vital process that a manager/lead must always held.

I had once a manager/lead that wanted to cancel all their 1:1s in the team, or to
reduce them to 15 minutes. They had too many other things to do and other
important meetings to attend. I also had a leader that cancel all of our 1:1s. This
leader first started by cancelling our 1:1 by sending a note over chat; then,
they cancel them by sending an email; then, they cancel by clicking 'no' to the
video invitation; and, then, they just removed it with no notification from
the calendar. These two examples, at least for me, are a big mistake. What
these two examples said to me was: "I, as a manager/lead, do not value your
work, and see no use in talking to you".

1:1s are perhaps the more important meeting one can have in order to understand
the health and the needs of a team. You cannot understand what a person needs from
second-hand telling, assumptions or gossip. You need to go to the source to
understand any need. And, yet, 1:1s are the types of meetings that are more
likely to be cancelled.

Perhaps, the reason why they get cancelled is because there is a misunderstanding
of what they are for. 1:1s are not status or report meetings. Status can be
the introduction or the framing, but not the core of the meeting. A healthy
1:1 is strategic: they must be valuable conversations.

1:1s are about moving information in such a way that that communication becomes
helpful. If you, as a manager, expect to go to a 1:1 and that an employee just
recites what they have been doing all week, then that meeting is useless. It
is useless for the employee as not help has been given, it is just a repetition
of a task. This is also the reason why I hate status reports.

From "Managing Humans" by Michael Lopp:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My belief is that e-mail-based status reports are one of the clearest and best
signs of managerial incompetence and laziness. There are always compelling
reasons why you need to generate these weekly e-mails. *We’re big enough that we
need to cross-pollinate. It’s just 15 minutes of your time*.

Bullshit. The presence of rigid, e-mail-based status reports comes down to
control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization.

I want you to count the number of collaboration tools you use on a daily basis
to do your job—not including e-mail. If you’re a software engineer, I’m guessing
it’s a combination of version control, bug tracking, wikis, CRM, Slack, and/or
project management software. All of these tools already automatically generate a
significant amount of status regarding what has tactically gone down each week.

When someone—my boss or someone who outranks me—asks for a status report, my
first thought is, “I’m already generating piles of status on these various
tools; why not just look at those?”

*Well, there’s a lot of noise in those tools.* So write a report that takes out
the noise—collaboration tools are built around reporting. The status information
is out there. In what managerial textbook does it say it’s a good idea to
distribute the task of figuring out what is going on to the people who are
performing the work? That’s, like, your job.

*Well, what I really want is your high-level assessment of the week. Three
things that are working, three things that aren’t, and what we’re going to do
about it.* OK, now we’re talking. I can do a strategic assessment of the week,
but why don’t we just put that at the beginning of the one-on-one? That way when
you have questions (and you will), we can have a big fat debate.

*But I’d like to have a record I can review later.* Super, feel free to write
down anything we talk about.

Yes, status reports are a hot button for me. I’ve written hundreds of them and
each time I’ve begun one, I start by thinking, “Why in the world do I feel like
I’m performing an unnecessary act?” Status reports usually show up because a
distant executive feels out of touch with part of his or her organization, and
they believe getting everyone to efficiently document their week is going to
help. It doesn’t. E-mailed status reports say one thing to 90 percent of the
people who write them: “You don’t value my time.”"

I whole heartedly agree with the quoted text. When I go to 1:1s with people
I mentor/lead/manage, I usually come prepared. I already know they have been
working on `x` feature because I reviewed the PR or saw it. I already know they
are interested on working on `x` because they said so in a team meeting or in a chat.
I have ways to find the information of what they have been doing by looking
at jira tickets, attending project meetings, reading git commits, opening
the slides of their presentations, and more. And, even if I don't have all the
information, I trust my colleagues to do the right work. I don't need to micromanage
anyone and I don't need them to repeat statuses for me. Those status found on jiras
or more, though, provide me with valuable information to discuss in our 1:1.

I usually write the things I want to discuss in the 1:1s. They involve either
coding together a solution, discussing the comments on a PR, figuring our together
how to run a meeting, finding the strategy to move some work forward and more.
And, more importantly, they also involve finding opportunities. If a person
casually says on chat or in a meeting that they are interested in `x` project,
then, I usually try to dig more. How interested are they? Is there a paper
around that project they will be interested that I can share? Is there a person
I can introduce them to? Is there a conference they can attend?

A 1:1 is also the place for me to share information that they might not know. This
might include the strategy of a project or the overall goals of a new line
of projects that are coming. This is very important because in the absence of
information, people start making up this information. And, worse, if they feel
threatened, they make up information that amplifies their worst fears. So, it is
important to state information clearly, specially, strategic one.

1:1 should be about creating meaningful conversations. And sometimes, it becomes
a vent. Something went wrong and people need to vent. That is ok, the job here
is to listen and not to advice (yet). Let the vent pass, and then you can
start finding solutions. But, if you don't listen first, people will think
you are not taking them seriously or that you are just there to shut them down.
I have had these conversations and I have had to stay silent watching someone
taking it all out of their chest. But only when the vent is finished, one can
start talking because only then all is out. I have also vented in the past
to managers and I think we all have had.

The worst kind of 1:1 is, as Lopp says, the Disaster.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here are some tips on recognizing and handling the Disaster:

* The person you’re talking to isn’t him- or herself. As you’re sitting there
  weathering the Disaster, remember that you are experiencing an anomaly—a
  bizarre emotional version of the person that only shows up when they’re on
  the edge. The person you’re familiar with will show up . . . eventually.
* Shut up. Really. Your primary job during the Disaster is to defuse, and you
  start defusing by contributing absolutely nothing. If you’re a logical,
  reasonable management type, you’ll be tempted to ask clarifying questions—to
  try to shape the problem. Don’t. Be quiet. Let the emotion pass. Here’s why . . .
* It’s not about the issue anymore. You’re no longer experiencing the problem.
  You’re experiencing the employee’s emotional baggage regarding the problem.
  Sure, there’s the core issue, but that’s not what you’re currently observing.
  You’re seeing the extreme negative reaction to the issue, and that’s the first
  order of business."

<br>
A disaster, though, is the result of poor management. "When your employee
believes totally losing their shit is a productive strategy, it’s because they
believe it’s the only option left for making anything change". And, most of
the times, they believe is the last option they have.

I have had two memorable disaster 1:1s. On the first, I failed to listen and
I failed to see my mistake. The employee resigned and I felt terrible. I later
apologized (not once, but at least five times on different occasions) and now
we are good friends. On the second, I listened and provided support. I couldn't
solve his problem: getting a much deserved raise, because it was out of my control.
But I tried, and showed him how much I tried. A disaster 1:1 can be recovered,
but one needs to listen and provide actual support. A disaster is usually
the result of miscommunication, so: "when communications are down, listen hard,
repeat everything, and assume nothing".

1:1s are also the time to understand what someone wants, what are their
core motivation. Do they want to lead? Do they want to be a team player?
Do they want to only do technical work? Not all people are you, and you will
need to learn who they are. A good way I use for this is to understand
what kind of jokes they like, what makes them tickle. This usually allows me
to start understanding them, and makes for a great way to break any tension.

1:1s are also a place to understand the health of a team. If people are not
talking about their important matters on their 1:1s, then, they don't trust you.
If you don't actually listen to them, cancel their 1:1s, micromanage their work,
and provide no support, people will not trust you. And people need to trust you.

It is also very important to believe whomever you are managing. This doesn't
mean believing them blindly; but if they brought up a topic up in a 1:1 (a meeting
that can be scary), then they actually feel like they need to say something.
Don't treat it lightly and do believe them. This is specially important when
talking about diversity and inclusion.

I remember once I had the experience of having an idea and that a male member took
credit for it. This is specially important for me as a woman, as women are less
recognized for the work they do and their contributions are usually
diminished. I brought this to the attention of a manager who didn't believe me and
provided no support. There was no response plan and no prevention of recurrence.
I lost my trust on that manager. Listen on 1:1s, understand your inner biases,
seek to see other points of view, and take seriously instances where inclusion
is being diminished.

I actually really like managing because I like people and I've loved everyone
I have mentored/lead/managed. I also see it as mental chess: trying to figure out
what the next steps will be. But it is not an easy job: "my definition of a
great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you
sit in the organization chart" (Lopp).
