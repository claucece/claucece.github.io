*Hear me as a woman. Have me as your sister.* -Amanda Gorman

Here, I'll like to have this place to list some of the amazing women in
science groups that help with supporting women, and creating inclusive
and diverse environments. I'll try to update this list regularly:

- [IETF Systers](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/ietf-systers/)
- [Women in Quantum Development](https://www.wiqd.nl/)
- [Angel Alerts](https://www.athenasangels.nl/en/angels-alerts)
- [Women in number theory](https://womeninnumbertheory.org/)
- [Women in Theory 2021](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/women-theory)

<br>
Soon, there will be a women in cryptography group ;)

Some first-hand experiences of discrimination and their impacts:
