<div class="explanation">
 <p>I'm a cyptography and security researcher at Brave. I specialize in privacy-enhancing technologies, lattice-based and multivariate-based cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, and real-world applications of zero-knowledge proofs. Previously, I contributed significantly to the Off-the-Record (OTR) messaging protocol and I'm a co-author the PQC Signature scheme "MAYO" submitted to NIST.<br>I also serve on the European review board at BlackHat and am a Free Researcher at KU Leuven. In addition, I am a member of the Advisory Council at the Open Technology Fund (OTF), and I server on various roles at the IETF/IRTF/W3C. I have also been involved in United Nations and other human rights NGOs as an expert consultation, focusing on the intersection of human rights and technical standard-setting for emerging technologies. As a co-founder of Criptolatinos and WinC, I am dedicated to fostering diversity in cryptography. In academic community service, I'm a member of the steering committee of Latincrypt, the publicity co-chair of the PETS symposium and the IACR eprint co-editor.</p>
