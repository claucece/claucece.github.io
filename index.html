<div class="explanation">
<p>I am a Senior Cryptography and Security Researcher at Brave, specializing in privacy-enhancing technologies, lattice-based and multivariate-based cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, and real-world applications of zero-knowledge proofs. I have contributed significantly to the Off-the-Record (OTR) messaging protocol and co-authored the PQC signature scheme "MAYO," submitted to NIST.<br> Beyond my research, I serve on the European Review Board at BlackHat and as a Free Researcher at KU Leuven. I am also a member of the Advisory Council at the Open Technology Fund (OTF) and hold various leadership roles within the IETF, IRTF, and W3C. My work extends to expert consultations for the United Nations and other human rights organizations, where I focus on the intersection of human rights and technical standards for emerging technologies.<br> As a co-founder of Criptolatinos and WinC, I am committed to fostering diversity in cryptography. I also contribute to the academic community as a member of the Latincrypt Steering Committee, Publicity Co-Chair of the PETS Symposium, and IACR ePrint Co-Editor. I live with my amazing partner, Jurre van Bergen, and have two doggies.</p>
