  I'm currently writing 4 secret papers. But for the published ones:
    <ul class="centered-list">
      <li>No evidence of communication: Off-The-Record Protocol version 4. Find it <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2018/files/hotpets/7-bini.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Privacy and deniability by design: Off-the-Record messaging version 4. Find it <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2019/files/workshop/abstracts/PUT_2019_paper_17.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
    <br>
  I've given tons of talks, that I'll eventually list over here ;)
